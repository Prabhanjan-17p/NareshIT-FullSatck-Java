✅ Task 2: Student Grade Management System Using Plain JDBC
🎯 Objective:
Build a console-based Java application using Plain JDBC to manage students and their grades. The system allows adding student records, viewing all students, and calculating the average marks.

✅ Features:
Add a new student (Student ID, Name, Subject, Marks)

View all student records

Calculate and display average marks of all students

🧱 Application Layers:
1️⃣ Model Layer (Entity)
Define a Student class with:

long Student ID

String Name

String Subject

double Marks

2️⃣ DAO Layer (Database Access)
Use Plain JDBC to perform:

Insert new student records

Retrieve all students

Compute average of all marks

3️⃣ Service Layer (Business Logic)
Delegate tasks to DAO

Provide methods to get all student data and calculate average marks

4️⃣ Controller Layer (Console UI)
Offer options to:

/add → Add student

/all → View all students

/average → Show average marks

🛢️ Database Setup (MySQL)
Table: students
Columns:

id (BIGINT, Primary Key)

name (VARCHAR)

subject (VARCHAR)

marks (DOUBLE)

🧪 Sample Use Case:
Add Student A (Math, 85.0)

Add Student B (Science, 95.0)

Average Marks: 90.0
