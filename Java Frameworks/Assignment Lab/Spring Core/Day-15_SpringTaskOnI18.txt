 Internationalization (i18n) Comprehensive Task ‚Äì Spring Core.
üìù Objective:
--------------
Demonstrate your understanding of Internationalization in Spring Core by completing a series of tasks using ResourceBundleMessageSource, ApplicationContext, and localized property files. You should handle multiple languages, dynamic user input, parameterized messages, and fallback mechanisms using both XML and Java-based configuration.

‚úÖ Tasks to Perform:
---------------------
Basic Language Switching
1.Display a welcome message in Hindi,English,Telugu and French using property files and a configured message source.

Console-Based Language Selection
Prompt the user to input a language code (like en or fr) and dynamically display the welcome message in the selected language.

Parameterized Messages
Use placeholders in message files to insert dynamic values like name or platform. Demonstrate this by greeting a user by name and mentioning the technology (e.g., "Hello Alice, welcome to Spring").

Default Fallback Message File
Add a base message file to support fallback when an unsupported locale (e.g., German) is used. Show that it falls back to default content.

Grouped Form Labels
Use message files to manage and retrieve multiple related messages such as form labels ‚Äî like name, email, and submit.

Custom Directory for Properties
Place your message files inside a custom folder (e.g., resources/i18n/) and configure Spring to load messages from this location.

Java-based Configuration (Optional Advanced)
Replace the traditional XML configuration with Java-based configuration using annotations, demonstrating full control over Spring's i18n setup programmatically.

üì¶ Resources You Will Work With:
Property files for different locales (messages_en.properties, messages_fr.properties, messages.properties)

Spring‚Äôs ResourceBundleMessageSource

ApplicationContext from Spring Core

Console for user input and interaction

XML-based and/or annotation-based Spring configuration
