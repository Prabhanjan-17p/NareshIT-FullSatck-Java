Program 1 :-
Programming Question: Student Class with Grade Calculation

 Design a Java class named Student that encapsulates information about 
 students, including name, ID, course, fee, grade, and average.
 Your class should include a constructor for creating a student object
 by copying another student object and a method to calculate the grade 
 based on the average.

Take a  Student class  (BLC Class)

should have the following elements:

Attributes/properties/varriables :


Names			data type		
------------		---------------       
Name      		: String
ID            		: int
Course  		: String
Fee			: double
Grade			: char
Average			: double

Acess Modifier 	:private(for all Varriables) 

Constructors:

A parameterized constructor that initializes a student object with basic information, such as name, ID, course, and fee.

A parameterized constructor that initializes a student object by copying another student object.(copy constructor)


Method:

Method Name    : calculateGrade()
Access modifier : public
Return Type       : char 
 
that initialize the grade of a student based on the average. Use the following grading scale:

A: Average >= 90
B: Average >= 80
C: Average >= 70
D: Average >= 60
F: Average < 60


Tester Class:(ELC Class)

In the main method, demonstrate the usage of the Student class by creating instances with different constructors, setting average values, and calculating grades.


Test Case-1 :
---------------
 Valid Case:

 Average = 76

 Sample Input: average = 76

Expected Output: "Grade for average 76: C"


Test Case-2 :
---------------

Valid Case: Average = 58

Sample Input: average = 58

Expected Output: "Grade for average 58: F"

Test Case-3 :
----------------
Invalid Case: mark = -10

Input: mark = -10
Expected Output: "Error: Average mark must be between 0 and 100."


--------------
Program 2:-
Create a class Employee (Business Logic Class)
Instance Variables:
employeeId :private-int
employeeName : private-String
employeeSalary: private-double

Create a parameterized constructor with the parameters: eid, ename, salary of type int,String,double respectively to initialize the instance variable of the class.

Create a static method getEmployeeObject() in the Employee class
Method Name : getEmployeeObject()
  Parameter : no parameter
Return type : Employee
Access modifier : public
getEmployeeObject() method of Employee class should take employeeId, employeeName,
employeeSalary from the keyboard to initialize the instance variables, Create and return the
Employee object from this method.
Override toString() from Object class to print Employee class properties.
Create another class Main which contains main method (ELC class). Accept 5 Employee Object
from keyboard and print their data using toString() method

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Program: 3
-----------
Create a class Employee (Business Logic Class)
Instance Variables:
employeeNumber : private-int
employeeName : private-String
Create a parameterized constructor with the parameters eno and ename of type int and String to
initialize the instance variable of the class.
Create getters method for both the instance variables.
Create another class Manager (Business Logic class)
Instance Variables:
managerId : private-int
managerName : private-String
Create a parameterized constructor which accept Employee class as a parameter, Initialize the
instance variable of Manager class with the help of Employee class properties
Override toString() from Object class to print Manager class properties.
Create another class Main which contains main method (ELC class) to print Manager data.
