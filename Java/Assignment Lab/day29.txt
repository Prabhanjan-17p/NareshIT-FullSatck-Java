                                        Inheritance Lab Exercise
==================================================================================================================
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Create a Program to Develop Hierarchical Inheritance for Employee Management System.
Here Employee is super class and it has two sub classes PermanentEmployee and ContractEmployee.
We need to display the details of PermanentEmployee including provident fund and net Salary.
We need to display the details of ContractEmployee including contract duration.

Coding Requirements :
-------------------------------
Create a BLC class called Employee.

Attributes/ Properties [protected]
employeeId - int
employeeName - String

employeeSalary - double

Create a Parameterized constructor to initialize all fields.
Create another BLC class PermanentEmployee which extends from Employee

Attributes/ Properties [protected]
providentfund - double

Create a parameterized constructor to initialize super class properties only
[Note : providentfund property will not initialize through constructor]

Initialize providentfund manually, It must be 12% of the salary.

Genarate toString() method to print all the properties of super class as well as sub
class.
[See the test cases for more details]

Method :
--------
Method Name : netSalary()
Modifier : public
Argument : No argument
return type : void

This method should print netSalary i.e salary + providentfund

Create another BLC class ContractEmployee which extends from Employee

Attributes/ Properties [protected]

contractDuration - int

Create a parameterized constructor to initialized all fields (super class and sub class)

Genarate toString() method to print all the properties of super class as well as sub
class.
[See the test cases for more details]

Create an ELC class EmployeeSystem which contains main method.

Create both sub class objects and print the result.

Test Cases for Output :
------------------------
Test Case 1 :
-------------
Enter permanent employee Id :101
Enter permanent employee Name :Scott
Enter permanent employee Salary :100000
PermanentEmployee [empoyeeId=101, employeeName=Scott,
employeeSalary=100000.0, providentfund=12000.0]
Net Salary is :112000.0
========================================
Enter contract employee Id :102

Enter contract employee Name :Smith
Enter contract employee Salary :80000
Enter contract duration in year :5
ContractEmployee [empoyeeId=102, employeeName=Smith,
employeeSalary=80000.0, contractDuration=5 years]

Test Cases for Input Validation :
---------------------------------
Test Cases 1:
-------------
Enter permanent employee Id :-90
Enter permanent employee Name :Scott
Enter permanent employee Salary :12000
Invalid Employee Id

Test Cases 2:
-------------
Enter permanent employee Id :101
Enter permanent employee Name :
Enter permanent employee Salary :6543
Employee Name can't be null

Test Cases 3 :
---------------
Enter permanent employee Id :120
Enter permanent employee Name :Alen

Enter permanent employee Salary :-78908
Salary can't be 0 or negative
