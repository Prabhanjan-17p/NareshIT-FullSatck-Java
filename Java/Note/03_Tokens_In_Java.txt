----------
Tokens in java :
----------------
Token is the smallest unit of the program which is identified by the compiler.

Without token we can't complete statement or expression in java.

Token is divided into 5 types in java

  1) Keyword
  2) Identifier
  3) Literal
  4) Punctuators (Seperators)  
  5) Operator
  
Keyword
--------
A keyword is a predefined word whose meaning is already defined by the compiler.

In java all the keywords must be in lowercase only.

A keyword we can't use as a name of the variable, name of the class or name of the method.  

true, false and null look like keywords but actually they are literals.

As of now, we have 67+ keywords in java.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifiers :
--------------
A name in java program by default considered as identifiers.

Assigned to variable, method, classes to uniquely identify them.

We can't use keyword as an identifier. 

Ex:-

class Fan 
{
   int coil  ;
   
   void switchOn()  
   {
   }
}

Here Fan(Name of the class), coil (Name of the variable) and switchOn(Name of the Method) are identifiers.

Rules for defining an identifier :
------------------------------------
1) Can consist of uppercase(A-Z), lowercase(a-z),  digits(0-9), $ sign, and underscore (_)
2) Begins with letter, $, and _
3) It is case sensitive
4) Cannot be a keyword
5) No limitation of length 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Literals :
----------
Any constant which we are assiging to variable is called Literal.

In java we have 5 types of Literals :

1) Integral Literal
2) Floating Point Literal
3) Boolean Literal
4) Character Literal
5) String Literal

Note : null is also a literal

Integral Literal :
-------------------
If a numeric literal does not contain any decimal or fraction then it is called Integral Literal.

Example : 90, 23, 67, 1234

In Integral literal we have total 4 data types :

 a) byte (8 bits)
 b) short (16 bits)
 c) int (32 bits)
 d) long (64 bits)

An integral literal we can represent in four different forms :
    a) Decimal Literal (Base is 10)
    b) Octal Literal (Base is 8)
    c) Hexadecimal Literal (Base is 16 [0-9 and a - f])
    d) Binary Literal (Base 2) [Available from JDK 1.7v]
    
Decimal Literal :
-----------------
By default our numeric literals are decimal literal. Here base is 10 so, It accepts 10 digits i.e. from 0-9.

Example : 
int x = 20;
int y = 123;
int z = 234;

Octal Literal :
---------------
If any Integer literal starts with 0 (Zero) then it will become octal literal. Here base is 8 so it will accept 8 digits i.e 0 to 7.

Example :

int a = 018; //Invalid becuase it contains digit 8 which is out of range
int b = 0777; //Valid
int c = 0123; //Valid

Hexadecimal Literal :
---------------------
If any integric literal starts with 0X or 0x (Zero capital X Or 0 small x) then it is hexadecimal literal. Here base is 16 so it will accept 16 digits i.e 0 to 9 and A to F OR [a to f]

Example :

int x = 0X12; //Valid
int y = 0xadd; //Valid
int z = 0Xface; //valid
int a = 0Xage; //Inavlid because character 'g' out of range

Binary Literal :
---------------
If a numeric literal starts with 0B (Zero capital B) or 0b (Zero small b) then it will become Binary literal. Binary literal is available from JDK 1.7v.
Here base is 2 so it will accept 2 digits i.e 0 and 1.

Example :
----------
int x = 0B101; //valid
int y = 0b111; //Valid
int z = 0B112; //Invalid [2 is out of range]

The deafult type is decimal literal so to generate the output for any different literal JVM converts into decimal literal.   		       
------------------------------------------------------------------
//Program on Octal Literal
		       
public class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int x = 015;
		System.out.println(x); //13
	}
}
