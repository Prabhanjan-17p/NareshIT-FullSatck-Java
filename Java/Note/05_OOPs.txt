Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)
-----------------------------------
Object Oriented Progamming means working with real life Objects so first of all we need to know that "What is an Object ?"

What is an Object ?
--------------------
An object is a physical entity which exist in the read world.
Example : Car, Mouse, Remote, Laptop and so on

An Object is having 3 characteristics :

1) Identification of the Object [Name of the Object]
2) State of an Object [Data OR Properties of an Object]
3) Functionality of the Object [What an object can perform]

An Object Oriented programming is a technique through which we can develop and design the programs using CLASS and OBJECT.

Writing Programs on real life Objects is known as Object Oriented Progamming.

In OOPs we concentrate on Objects rather than function(Method).

Advantages of OOPs :
-------------------
There are 3 advantages :

1) Modularity (Dividing the bigger task into number of smaller task)
2) Reusability (We can reuse the BLC classes [WORA])
3) Flexibility (Easy to maintain [Interface])

Features Of OOPs :
------------------
There are six features :

1) Class
2) Object
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation
5) Inheritance
6) Polymorphism

What is a class :
