Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)
-----------------------------------
Object Oriented Progamming means working with real life Objects so first of all we need to know that "What is an Object ?"

What is an Object ?
--------------------
An object is a physical entity which exist in the read world.
Example : Car, Mouse, Remote, Laptop and so on

An Object is having 3 characteristics :

1) Identification of the Object [Name of the Object]
2) State of an Object [Data OR Properties of an Object]
3) Functionality of the Object [What an object can perform]

An Object Oriented programming is a technique through which we can develop and design the programs using CLASS and OBJECT.

Writing Programs on real life Objects is known as Object Oriented Progamming.

In OOPs we concentrate on Objects rather than function(Method).

Advantages of OOPs :
-------------------
There are 3 advantages :

1) Modularity (Dividing the bigger task into number of smaller task)
2) Reusability (We can reuse the BLC classes [WORA])
3) Flexibility (Easy to maintain [Interface])

Features Of OOPs :
------------------
There are six features :

1) Class
2) Object
3) Abstraction
4) Encapsulation
5) Inheritance
6) Polymorphism

What is a class :
-------------------
A class is a model/bluprint/template/prototype for creating the Object. Object creation is possible by using class template.

A class is a logical entity which does not take any space.

A class is user-defined data type which contains fields and methods.

Example :
---------
public class Demo
{
   Fields 
     + 
   Methods
}

*A class is a component which is used to defined Object properties and Object behavior.
 
 public class Student
 {
    Fields [Student Properties]    
      +      
    Methdos [Student Behavior]
 }
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
WAP to provide student properties and student behavior by using OOP.
(Diagram is available)

Student.java
--------------
package com.ravi.oop;

//BLC
public class Student 
{
	int rollNumber;         //Non static variable
	String studentName;     //Non static variable
	String studentAddress;  //Non static variable
	
	public void talk()
	{
		System.out.println("My name is :"+studentName);
		System.out.println("Roll number is :"+rollNumber);		
		System.out.println("Address is :"+studentAddress);
	}

	public void writeExam()
	{
		System.out.println("Hello Everyone !!!, My name is :"+studentName+ " every saturday we have weekly test");
	}
	
	
}

StudentDemo.java
-----------------
package com.ravi.oop;

//ELC
public class StudentDemo 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Student  raj = new Student();
		//Initializing the properties through reference variable
        raj.rollNumber = 111;
        raj.studentName = "Raj";
        raj.studentAddress ="Ameerpet";
        
        //calling the behavior
        raj.talk();
        raj.writeExam();
        
        System.out.println("-------------------");
        
        Student priya = new Student();
        //Initializing the properties through reference variable
        priya.rollNumber = 222;
        priya.studentName = "Priya";
        priya.studentAddress = "S R Nagar";
        
        //calling the Behavior
        priya.talk();
        priya.writeExam();
        
	}

}

Steps to develop OOP :
----------------------
1) Create BLC and ELC class.
2) Create an Objec for BLC class, inside the ELC class in the main 
   method.
3) Think about Object properties and behavior and write inside the 
   BLC class.
4) In the ELC class, With the help of Object reference initialize
   all the Object properties.
5) By using Object reference call the methods.
