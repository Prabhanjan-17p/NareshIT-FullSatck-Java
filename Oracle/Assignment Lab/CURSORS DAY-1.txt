                         CURSORS
                            ===========

      Cursor is a private sql memory area which is used to process
multiple records and also this is an record by record process.


  *         /To process multiple records.
 *** CURSOR
  *         \record by record process.


    Oracle having two types of static cursors.These are
1)Implicit cursor
2)Explicit cursor

2)Explicit cursor:-for sql statements return multiple records is 
=================  called explicit cursor.explicit cursor memory area
                   is also called  as "active set area".in explicit
cursor internally having record by record process.

Explicit cursor life cycle
==========================
       Every explicit cursor having following 4 step process.these
are

1)declare
2)open
3)fetch
4)close

1)declare:-in declare section of the pl/sql block we are declaring
            the cursor by using following syntax.

syntax:-
=======
cursor cursorname is select * from tablename
where condition;

eg:-
===
SQL>declare
    cursor c1 is select * from emp
    where job='CLERK';

2)open:-whenever we are opening the cursor then only oracle server
======  retrive data from table into cursor memory area.because in all
        relational databases whenever we are opening the cursor then
        only cursor select statements are executed.

syntax:-
======
open cursorname;

    in oracle this open statement is used in exeutable section of
the pl/sql block.

NOTE:-Every cursor memory area internally having a pointer whenever
====   we are opening the cursor.this cursor pointer always points
      to first record in cursor memory area.

3)fetch:-(fetching data from cursor memory area)
================================================
  By using fetch statement we are fetching data from cursor memory
area into pl/sql variables

syntax:-
=======
fetch cursorname into variablename1,variablename2;

4)close:-whenever we are closing the cursor then automatically all
========  the resources allocated from cursor memory area is 
          automatically released.

syntax:-
=======
close cursorname;

1.Write a pl/sql explicit cursor program which is used  display all employee names and their salaries from emp table by using %notfound attribute?

1)%notfound:-This attribute always returns boolean value either true or false.this attribute returns true whenever  fetch stmt does not fetches any row from cursor memory area.
where as it returns false when fetch stmt fetches atleast one row 
from cursor memory are.

syntax:-
=======
cursorname%notfound;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.Write a pl/sql cursor program which is used to display total salary from emp table without using sum() function ?



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.Write a pl/sql cursor program to find the maximum salary without using max function by using %rowcount attribute?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.Write a pl/sql explicit cursor program which is used to display even no of records from emp table by using %rowcount attribute?

%rowcoununt:-This attribute always returns number data type.i.e it counts no of records fetched from cursor memory area.
