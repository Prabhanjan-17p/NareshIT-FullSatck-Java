                               SPECIAL OPERATORS
                             ====================

1)In operator 
-------------

1.In:- It is used to pick the values one by one
=====        from list of values. 
                  (or) 
it is used to compare column value with list of values.
 

   we can also use in operator in place of OR operator.
when we are retriving multiple values from the same column
in this case In operator performance is very high compared 
to OR operator.
 
.it avoids writing multi equality condition using OR operator.


1.Write a query to display the employees whose are belongs to
  20,30,50,70,90 from emp table by using in operator.

          select * from emp where empno in (7902,7788,7900);

2.Write a query to display the employee records whose names
  are SMITH,JONES,KING from emp table?
          Select * from amp where ename in ('SMITH','JONES','KING');
          

3.Write a query to display the employee records whose empnos
  are 7902,7788,7900 from emp table?
          select * from emp where empno in (7902,7788,7900);

4.Write a query to display the employee records whose sal 
  is 1250,3000,5000 from emp table?
          select * from emp where sal in (1250,3000,5000);

5.Write a query to display the employee records except 
  MANAGERS and CLERKS from emp table?
          Select * from where emp not in ('MANAGER','CLERKS');

6.Write a query to display the employees who are belongs to other
  than 10,20 from emp table?
         Select * from emp deptno not in (10,20);

7.SQL>select * from emp where deptno not in(10,20,null);

o/p:no rows selected


why not in operator does not work with null?
============================================
.not in operator internally uses iogical AND.

Note:- Whenever we are using IN operator then internally database 
====   servers uses logical OR.whenever we are using NOT IN operator
       then database server internally useslogical AND that's why 
       NOT IN does not work with null values. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Between And operator
------------------------
2)Between:-This operator is used to retrive range of values from a
========== table column.This operator is also call as Betweenâ€¦.. And
           operator.

.it is used to compare column values with range of values.

.in oracle Between operator work with number,date data type columns.
 


1.Write a query to display the employees who are getting salary 
         between 2000 to 5000 from emp table 
              by using Between operator? 
        select * from emp where sal between 2000 and 5000;

2.Write a query to display the employees who are getting salary 
        not between 2000 - 5000 from emp table
              by using Between operator?
        select * from emp where sal not between 2000 and 5000;
 
3.Write a query to display the employee records who joined 
  in 1982 from emp table?
        select * from emp where hiredate between '01-JAN-1982' and '31-DEC-1982';

4.Write a query to display the employee records except joined 
  in 1981 from emp table?
       select * from emp where hiredate not  between '01-JAN-1981' and '31-DEC-1981';

5 What is the o/p of the following
  select ename,sal from emp where sal Between 5000 and 2000; 
  A.displays between 2000 & 5000 salaries
  B.Error
  C.No rows selected         -------> because it use first greater than(no) and then less than
  D.None
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)is null and is not null
  -----------------------
   These two operators used in where clause only.These two 
operators are used to test weather a column having null 
values or not.

.for null comparision we must use is null operator.dont use = operator.


1.Write a query to display the employees who are not getting 
  commission from emp table? 
        select * from emp where comm is null;

2.Write a query to display the employees who are getting commission
   from emp table? 
         select * from emp where comm is not  null;

3.Write a query to display the employee record who are not having 
  the manager from emp table?
         select * from emp where job not in('MANAGER');

SQL>SELECT * FROM EMP
    WHERE MGR IS NULL;

       EMPNO ENAME    JOB             MGR HIREDATE        SAL    COMM    DEPTNO 
________ ________ ____________ ______ ___________ _______ _______ _________ 
    7839 KING     PRESIDENT           17-11-81       5000                10
