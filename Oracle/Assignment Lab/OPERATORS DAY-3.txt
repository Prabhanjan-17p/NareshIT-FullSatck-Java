                          OPERATORS TASK
                        =================
 

4.like operator:-like operator is used to retrive data based on 
===============   specified pattern in where clause.

.like operator performance is very high compare to oracle predefined 
  searching functions.

.In all  relational databases along with like operator oracle provided 2 special
  wild card charcters.These are having special meaning.

1)% -> string or group of characters matching(replaces 0 or 
       any no of characters)
2)_ -> single character matching purpose(replaces 1 char)

1)Arthematic operators
----------------------
.Airthemetic operators are used in number,date datatype columns.

.Aithmetic operators are used in select clause.Rarely we are
 using in where clause.

1.Write a query to display ename,sal,annsal from emp table?

--------- select ename, sal, sal*12 AS ANNUAL_SALARY from emp;

2.Calculate the experience of the all employees from emp table?

--------- select ename,job,to_char(sysdate,'yyyy')-to_char(hiredate,'yyyy') as experiance from emp;

calculation of experience of emp means :so many date functions are there
one date function is suitable for calculating exp i.e sysdate

sysdate:it returns current date of the system in oracle date 
=======    format.in oracle by default date formatt
                        is DD-MON-YY

3.Calculate TA,HRA,TAX and NETSAL from emp table based on
  following condintions?

10% on sal=>TA
20% on sal=>HRA
5% on sal=>TAxNETSAL =SAL+TA+HRA-TAX

[TA--->Total Allowance  HRA--->House Rent Allowances   NETSAL--->Take-home Salary]

Gross Salary includes all earnings (before deductions).

Net Salary is the actual salary received after all deductions.

---------- SELECT 
         ename, 
         sal AS Gross_Salary,                       -- Gross Salary before deductions
         sal * 0.10 AS TA,                          -- Total Allowance (10% of salary)
         sal * 0.20 AS HRA,                         -- House Rent Allowance (20% of salary)
         sal * 0.05 AS TAX,                         -- Tax deduction (5% of salary)
         sal + (sal * 0.10) + (sal * 0.20) - (sal * 0.05) AS NETSAL  -- Take-home salary
     FROM 
         emp;

-------- select ename, sal as Gross_salary , sal * 0.10 as TA, sal * 0.20 as HRA, sal * 0.05 as TAX , sal+ sal * 0.10 + sal * 0.20 - sal * 0.05 as netsalary from emp;

4.Write a query to display the all employee salaries after 
  adding 1200 rupees?

--------------   select ename,sal+1200 as sal from emp;

5.create the student1 table and insert the records as below(this table u already 
                                                             created.)

   sno      sname      sub1         sub2        sub3 
  -----    -------    ------       ------      ------

    2       kiran       60          50          45
    3       raju        12          30          25
    4       subbu       80          88          74

Q)Calculate the total marks of students?

--------- select sname,sub1+sub2+sub3 as marks from student1;

Q)Calculate the average marks?

--------- select sname,round((sub1+sub2+sub3)/3,2) as avg from student1;

1.Write a query To display employee who are working as a 
  MANAGER,CLERK and 
  earning salary between 1500 and 3000 and
