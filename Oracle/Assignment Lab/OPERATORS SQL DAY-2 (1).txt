2)Relational operators

.Relational operators are used in where clause only.

.Every relational operator used to compare with 1 value.

.Oracle sql having following relational operators.
 =,<,<=,>,>=,<> or !=


.Where clause is used to filtering the rows or resticting the 
 records purpose we are using.

1.Write a query to display the employee records whose 
  salary is 3000?

2.Write a query to display all managers from emp table?

Note:-Oracle is not a case sensitive language.But string comparision 
====      is case sensitive.

Note:Generally in all relational databases we are not allowed to use
     column aliasname in where clause.

column aliasname:Is used to change column heading in final output.
.to give column aliasname we use "AS" keyword.using "AS" keyword is 
 optional.
.to give column aliasname as multiple words use " ".
.eg "ann sal"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Logical operators
-----------------
.In all relational databases if you want to define more than one 
   condition in where clause
then we must use either AND or by using OR operators.

AND:-AND operator displays the record if both first condition & 
====  second contion are true.

OR:-OR operator is used to displays a record if either first 
===   condition or second condition is true.



eg:-Online shopping(searching for the products)

 select * from student1 where sub1>=35 and sub2>=35 and sub3>=35;
