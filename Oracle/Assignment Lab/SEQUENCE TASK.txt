                                SEQUENCE
                              ===========

1.What is Sequence ? What is main purpose of Sequence?
  - it is a database object which is used to generate sequence numbers on a specific column in the table automatically. 
  - it will provide "auto incremental value" facility on a table. 

2.Create a sequence ?Sequence stat with 5 and generate values upto 10

SQL> CREATE SEQUENCE SQ1
2  START WITH 5
3  MINVALUE 1
4  INCREMENT BY 1
5  MAXVALUE 10;
SQL> CREATE TABLE TEST10 (SLNO NUMBER(2),NAME VARCHAR2(10));
SQL> INSERT INTO TEST10 VALUES(SQ1.NEXTVAL,'&NAME');

3.Genarate the primary key values for the following column sno by using sequence.

SQL>create table test(sno number(10) primary key,name varchar2(10));

---->create a sequence first 
---->create the table test table as shown in above
---->insert into test(sno,name)values(s1.nextval,'&name');
---->only we are proving the values to name column.by using
     sequence pseudo column nextval we are generating values 
     automatically to sno column.


---->after inserting the records add Rollno column

SNO      NAME       ROLLNO
---     ------     --------
1        GOWTHAM     
2        SUBBARAO    
3        RAJU        
4        KIRAN  

---->create one more sequence s2 and stating value is 73     

---->by using one update command with sequence pseudo 
     column(nextval)
     genarate the output as follows

SNO      NAME       ROLLNO
---     ------     --------
1        GOWTHAM     73
2        SUBBARAO    74
3        RAJU        75
4        KIRAN       76

SQL> CREATE SEQUENCE s1 START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;

SQL> CREATE TABLE TEST11 (sno NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY,name VARCHAR2(10));

SQL> INSERT INTO test11 (sno, name) VALUES (s1.NEXTVAL, 'GOWTHAM');
SQL> INSERT INTO test11 (sno, name) VALUES (s1.NEXTVAL, 'SUBBARAO');
SQL> INSERT INTO test11 (sno, name) VALUES (s1.NEXTVAL, 'RAJU');
SQL> INSERT INTO test11 (sno, name) VALUES (s1.NEXTVAL, 'KIRAN');

SQL> ALTER TABLE test11 ADD rollno NUMBER(10);

SQL> CREATE SEQUENCE s2 START WITH 73 INCREMENT BY 1;

SQL> UPDATE test11 SET rollno = s2.NEXTVAL;


4.NOTE:-Oracle 12c onwards we can also use sequence pseudo columns
        with in default clause

syntax:-
=======
columnname number(size) default sequencename.nextval primary key

--->Create a sequence first and sequence start with 1001
--->Create table test1 with ACCNO column by using above syntax
    and NAME,BAL columns
--->Insert the values only NAME,BAL columns by using 
    skipping columns method
--->And observe the output and beauty of sequence

NOTE:-This kind of EXAMPLE is very usefull in Advance Java JDBC
         
5.What is cache?what is default size of cache?
ANS- when we created a sequence object with "cache" then the set of sequence 
  numbers are saved in database and also the copy of data keep in cache memory. 
  so that each and every user request is going to cache instead of database and  
  fetching data from cache to client application.so that it reduce the burdon on  
  database and improve the performance of database.
ANS- The default size of cache is 2kb;
