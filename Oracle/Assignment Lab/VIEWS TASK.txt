                                  VIEWS
                                =========

1.What is view? View store data or not? How can you give the guarantee view does not store the data?
ANS-
  - A view is a virtual table based on a SQL query that does not store data but retrieves it dynamically from base tables
  - view does not store data it only stores the SQL query definition.
  - Changes in the base table are immediately reflected in the view, proving it does not store data.

2.Create a view from emp table with following columns
  empno,ename,sal,deptno
  After creating the view insert the records
  into view?

  SQL> CREATE VIEW V1 AS SELECT empno,ename,sal,deptno FROM EMP;
  SQL> INSERT INTO V1 VALUES(1212,'ASDD',2345,10);  

3.After creating the view v1 on empno,ename,sal,deptno.give the access on view v1 to other user?

SQL> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON V1 TO (USER_NAME);
SQL> SELECT * FROM OWNER_NAME.V1;

3.Create view from emp table and store only department 10th details?

SQL> CREATE VIEW V2 AS SELECT * FROM EMP WHERE DEPTNO = 10;

4.What is comlex view ? Create a complex view from the following two tables ?Can you perform DML operations through complex view to base table possible or not possible? 

SQL>create table test1(name varchar2(10));
SQL>create table test2(sub varchar2(10));

ANS-
- Is created using multiple tables (joins, unions, subqueries).
- On complex view we cannot perform DML operations. 
SQL> CREATE VIEW V3 AS SELECT T1.NAME , T2.SUB FROM TEST8 T1 CROSS JOIN TEST9 T2;
SQL> SELECT * FROM V3;

5.What is Materialized view? MVIEWS stores data or not?What is the Purpose of MVIEWS?

6.What are the differences b/w View and Materialized VIEW?

 *
***Differnce b/w view & materialized view(V.V.I.M.P)
 * ======================================

          View                              Materialized view
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.view does not stores any data     |1.M.views stores data
                                    |
2.security purpose                  |2.improves performance(for joins,aggrigate
                                    |  functions)purpose.

3.when we are dropping a base table |3.when we are dropping a base table  
  then view can not be accessable.  |  also. M.view can be accessable. 
                                    |
4.we can perform dml operations on  |4.we can not perform dml operations on
  views                             |  M.views



7.What are the uses of the views?
- The main purpose of views is security and data hiding.
- it is a virtual object / subset of a base table(i.e main table). 
- it does not store data but it can access data from a base table. 
- whenever we perform DML operations on a view internally those operations are executed on a base table and refelected in view      table to user.
