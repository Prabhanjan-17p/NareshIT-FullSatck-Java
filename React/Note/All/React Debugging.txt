Debugging
1. Chrome React Dev Tools

    - Monitoring State    
    - Monitoring Props
    - Monitoring Component

    a) values stored in state
    b) controlled component properties and values
    c) hierarchy of components

   > Run your react Vite app in dev mode
       
           npm run dev

   > Launch application in Chrome browser   http://localhost:5173

   > Right Click and Inspect in browser to open Debugging Tools

   > Go to "Components" to view the hierarchy and select component to view
       Its props, state and dependencies.

   > Go to Profiler to monitor the render time for every component.

Note: To monitor actual DOM cycle you have to go to Chrome Dev Tools "Performance"
          category and use the "record" button to start profiling.

2. Go to useEffect() hook in component and add "debugging", to setup break points.


                            Testing
- Testing is the process of verifying "AS-IS" & "TO-BE".
- AS-IS refers to developer design & logic.
- TO-BE refers to client requirement.

        AS-IS === TO-BE        Test Pass
        AS-IS !==  TO-BET        Test Fail

- React can use various testing frameworks  
        a) Jasmine Karma
        b) JEST
        c)  VI Test etc.
