Ans: It is used to force developers to following good coding techniques.
     It reduces code inconsistency.
     It compiles and executes the application for development & production.

*** FAQ's:
1. What is [getter, setter] referring to?
A. It refers to de-structuring declaration.

2. Why you are using const for declaring state, can we use var or let?
A.
     - State must be initialized.
     - Var & Let allows to ignore initialization, hence they are not recommended.
     - State can't be assigned after initialization.
     - Var & Let allows assignment, hence they are not good.
     - State must be initialized first then you can use it.
     - Var allows hoisting, hence it is not good for state.
     - Yes we can use var & let to declare state but not recommended.

3. Why const for state?
A.
    - It allows only initialization.
    - It will not allow assignment
    - It will not allow shadowing and hoisting.

4. How you can configure a new value into state if it is declared with const?
A  We will not assign value into const.
     We re-initialize value into const.

Syntax:
       const  [uname, setUname] = useState("John");
     
           setUname = "David";        // invalid - assignment to const is not valid
           setUname("David");        // valid
