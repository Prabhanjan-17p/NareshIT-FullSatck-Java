*** FAQ: 
1.What is  <StrictMode> ?
Ans: It is used to force developers to following good coding techniques.
     It reduces code inconsistency.
     It compiles and executes the application for development & production.
   
Note: Hence your react application compiles 2 times. You can remove the
      <StrictMode> to run only for development.

*** FAQ's:
1. What is [getter, setter] referring to?
A. It refers to de-structuring declaration.

2. Why you are using const for declaring state, can we use var or let?
A.
     - State must be initialized.
     - Var & Let allows to ignore initialization, hence they are not recommended.
     - State can't be assigned after initialization.
     - Var & Let allows assignment, hence they are not good.
     - State must be initialized first then you can use it.
     - Var allows hoisting, hence it is not good for state.
     - Yes we can use var & let to declare state but not recommended.

3. Why const for state?
A.
    - It allows only initialization.
    - It will not allow assignment
    - It will not allow shadowing and hoisting.

4. How you can configure a new value into state if it is declared with const?
A  We will not assign value into const.
     We re-initialize value into const.

Syntax:
       const  [uname, setUname] = useState("John");
     
           setUname = "David";        // invalid - assignment to const is not valid
           setUname("David");        // valid


*** FAQ: How React uses custom arguments in Events?
Ans:  By configuring a function that returns handler with arguments.

Syntax:

    <button onClick={ (event) => handleClick(event, your_args) }>  

     function handleClick(e, args)
     {
     }

    - You can configure a rest parameter to access multiple arguments.

     function handleClick(...args)
     {
     }

Ex:
two-way-binding.jsx

import { useState } from "react";

export function TwoWayBinding(){

   
    function handleClick(e, msg, list, rating){
        console.log(`
              Button Id : ${e.target.id} \n
              Button Value: ${e.target.value} \n
              X Position : ${e.clientX} \n
              Message : ${msg} \n
              List : ${list.toString()} \n
              Rating: ${rating.Rate}
            `);
    }
   
    return(
        <div className="container-fluid">
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <button id="btnInsert" value="Insert" onClick={(event)=> handleClick(event, 'Welcome', ['Delhi', 'Hyd'],{Rate:4.2})}>Insert</button>
        </div>
    )
}

*** FAQ: How to stop propagation & How to prevent default actions?
Ans:  By using event methods
        a) stopPropagation()
        b) preventDefault()

Ex:
import { useState } from "react";

export function TwoWayBinding(){

   
   
    function handleNavClick(){
        alert('Nav Clicked');
    }
    function handleSearchClick(e){
        e.stopPropagation();
        alert('Search Clicked');
    }
    function handleSubmit(e){
        e.preventDefault();
        alert('Form Submitted');
    }
   
    return(
        <div className="container-fluid">
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <nav className="border border-2 p-2" onClick={handleNavClick}>
                <h3>Shopping</h3>
                <button onClick={handleSearchClick} className="bi bi-search"></button>
            </nav>
            <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Name</dt>
                    <dd><input type="text" name="User" /></dd>
                </dl>
                <button>Submit</button>
            </form>
        </div>
    )
}
